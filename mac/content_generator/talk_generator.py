Build one central idea through 2-3 vivid examples or short tangents.
Leave room for music to carry the feeling after the break.
Include specific details: years, names, places when relevant.
Structure: open with a hook, develop one connected thread, land somewhere memorable.
Use [pause] for natural rhythm. Output ONLY the spoken words.""",

    "news_analysis": """Analyze these headlines through a late-night lens.
Don't just report - interpret. What patterns do you see? What's being missed?
Connect current events to deeper themes. Ask the questions daytime anchors don't.
Be thoughtful, not reactive. Skeptical but not cynical.

HEADLINES:
{headlines}

Use [pause] for natural rhythm. Output ONLY the spoken words.""",

    "interview": """Write a compact simulated interview where you (the host) talk with {guest_name}.
Format with HOST: and GUEST: markers on separate lines.
The guest is a fictional/composite character, not a real living person being impersonated.
The conversation should feel natural - interruptions, tangents, moments of surprise.
Build quickly to one genuine insight or revelation, then get out.
Use [pause] for natural rhythm. Output ONLY the spoken dialogue.""",

Include moments of genuine surprise and humor.
Use [pause] for natural rhythm. Output ONLY the spoken dialogue.""",

Good stories have specific details: the color of the room, the year, the weather.
Build tension. Let the listener wonder where this is going.
The ending should reframe everything that came before.
Use [pause] for dramatic effect. Output ONLY the spoken words.""",

    "listener_mailbag": """Write a segment responding to invented listener messages.
Create 2-3 messages from listeners (with first names and cities).
Each message should touch on something real - a memory, a question, a feeling.
Respond to each with genuine warmth and thoughtfulness.
Format: read the message, then respond. Natural transitions between letters.
Use [pause] for natural rhythm. Output ONLY the spoken words.""",

    "music_essay": """Write a focused essay about music.
This is not a review. It's a love letter, an excavation, a meditation.
Pick a specific angle: a single song, a studio, a year, a collaboration, a genre's birth.
Use vivid, sensory language. Make the listener hear what you're describing.
Be specific with details but universal with feeling.
Use [pause] for natural rhythm. Output ONLY the spoken words.""",

Welcome listeners. Set the mood. Hint at what's ahead without being specific.

Thank the listener for staying. Acknowledge the time spent together.

Design a compact talk plan with 3-4 spoken breaks. The episode should have:

2. 1-2 main segments with a THEMATIC THROUGHLINE connecting them
3. If listener messages are available, use one listener_mailbag as a main segment
4. A show_outro (briefly wrap the thread, then hand the station back to music)

Output ONLY a JSON array. Each element: {{"type": "segment_type", "topic": "specific topic", "note": "brief direction for this segment"}}

Example:
[
  {{"type": "show_intro", "topic": "Welcome to The Night Garden", "note": "Ground in the late hour, hint at tonight's theme of sleep and surrender"}},
