"""
ezstream playlist intake program for RGNRD-FM.

Reads output/.playlist.m3u (managed by feeder.py) and returns one filename
per invocation, advancing through the list. Tracks position by reading
the previous track from output/.current_track.txt.

Side effects:
- Writes the returned filename to .current_track.txt. That file is the
  shared source of truth — stream_metadata.sh reads it to compose the
  Icecast metadata, feeder.py reads it to populate the now-playing API.
- Archives the previous track to {slot}/aired/ if it lived in a slot
  folder (matching YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM). That's how the station enforces
  "never plays again within the same slot" across crashes/restarts.

ezstream calls this script per track. End-of-playlist behaviour: wraps
to the first track in the current playlist, since the playlist file is
constantly rebuilt by feeder.py for whatever show is airing.
